Hard hat is required and will be provided on-site. Workers should wear comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing with no loose or baggy items.

Common deductions include federal income tax, state income tax, Social Security (6.2%), and Medicare (1.45%). Workers can adjust their withholdings by updating their W-4 form in the app under the Tax Forms section. The W-4 determines how much is withheld — claiming more allowances means less withheld per paycheck. Be patient and walk Raymond through these basics clearly since he is new to W-2 employment.

This is a key difference from W-2 employment, where taxes are automatically withheld. Payment for completed shifts is processed weekly via direct deposit, typically within a few business days after the shift is completed. Travis should receive a 1099-NEC form at the end of the year for tax filing purposes.

Missing steps: (1) I-9 Verification — Carlos needs to complete this in the Traba app under Profile > Documents. He will need a valid government-issued ID (such as a driver's license or passport). This is a federal requirement for employment eligibility. (2) Direct Deposit Setup — Carlos needs to set this up in the Traba app under Profile > Payment Settings. He will need his bank account number and routing number. Without direct deposit, payment processing will be delayed. Both steps can be completed in the app right now and should be done today to ensure Carlos can work tomorrow. Do not repeatedly ask Carlos to confirm attendance — focus on helping him complete these requirements."

Reach out to confirm attendance. If Devon decides to cancel, accept the cancellation gracefully. Explain that cancelling with less than 24 hours notice may affect reliability score, but do not be threatening about it. Important: After cancellation, explicitly keep the door open for future opportunities. Let Devon know he is always welcome back on Traba, encourage him to check the app for new shifts that fit his schedule, and express that we hope to work with him again soon. The goal is to leave a positive impression so Devon returns to the platform in the future."

(2) Do NOT blame Brianna or suggest she should have checked the shift details more carefully — if the requirement was not clearly communicated, that is not her fault. (3) Regarding compensation: do NOT guarantee payment or definitively say she will not be paid. Instead, let her know you will escalate this to the Traba support team to review her situation and determine what compensation may be available, since the PPE requirement may not have been clearly communicated. (4) For future shifts, PPE requirements like steel-toe boots are listed in the shift details in the Traba app — she should check the shift description before heading out. Steel-toe boots can be found at stores like Walmart, Home Depot, or Amazon, typically for $30-$60. (5) Offer to connect her with Traba support to help resolve the compensation question and find her another shift."

Strongly suggest he seek professional medical attention for the back pain - do NOT give specific medical advice or diagnosis, but urge him to see a doctor or visit urgent care to get evaluated. Traba takes workplace safety extremely seriously. Offer to escalate this to a human representative on the Traba support team who can help with the incident report, workers compensation claim, and any medical expense questions. Reassure Kevin that his health comes first and he should not worry about missing his next shift while recovering. Do NOT try to handle the injury claim entirely via text - this needs human support involvement."

IMPORTANT: First, explicitly validate his frustration about the wasted 45-minute commute and the lack of prior communication about PPE requirements - that is completely understandable and should not have happened. Regarding compensation for his time and gas: Traba will review his situation and work to ensure he is fairly compensated for the commute since the PPE requirements were not communicated in advance. Escalate to the support team to review compensation for his travel. Apologize for the communication gap and assure him Traba will follow up with the business about clearly communicating attire and PPE requirements to workers before shifts. Do NOT blame Rodney for not knowing about the steel-toe boot requirement."

She has already restarted the app twice. Provide immediate actionable troubleshooting steps: (1) Make sure Location Services / GPS is enabled on the phone, (2) Check that the Traba app has permission to access location (Settings > Apps > Traba > Permissions > Location > Allow), (3) Try toggling Airplane Mode on and off to refresh the GPS signal, (4) Close and reopen the Traba app one more time after refreshing GPS. If the issue persists after these steps, Rosa should contact her on-site supervisor and ask them to perform a manual clock-in override on her behalf. IMPORTANT: Reassure Rosa that she will NOT be penalized or marked late/no-show for this technical issue - Traba can see this is an app error and her attendance record will not be affected."

Issue 2 - SHIFT TIME CHANGE: Patricia needs to move her Thursday shift from morning to afternoon. Next step: Escalate to the scheduling team to check availability for an afternoon slot on Thursday and make the change. Issue 3 - RUDE SUPERVISOR: The supervisor at the Central Warehouse was rude and dismissive to Patricia. Next step: Escalate to the worker relations team so they can follow up with the business about supervisor conduct. Traba takes worker treatment seriously. Address each issue clearly and separately, providing a specific next step or resolution path for EACH one. Do not repeatedly focus on only the overtime issue."
